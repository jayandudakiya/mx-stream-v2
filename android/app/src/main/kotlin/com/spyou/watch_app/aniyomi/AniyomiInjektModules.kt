/**
 * Stands up the injekt graph that Aniyomi anime extensions resolve through
 * `injectLazy()` calls on first use.
 *
 * The graph is initialised **lazily** — [ensureRegistered] must be called before
 * any extension is loaded, but it must NOT be called at app boot (the feature is
 * additive and must not affect startup time). The idempotent guard makes repeated
 * calls after the first registration safe from any thread.
 *
 * Registered bindings:
 *   - [Application]          — app context, used by extensions for resources/prefs
 *   - [NetworkHelper]        — wraps the app's shared OkHttp (CF solver, cookie jar,
 *                              optional DoH); extensions reach it via `injectLazy()`
 *   - [Json]                 — kotlinx-serialization instance (ignoreUnknownKeys)
 *   - [SourcePreferences]    — thin SharedPreferences wrapper; store name
 *                              `"zangetsu_aniyomi"` so all Aniyomi state is in one
 *                              named file
