// Genre chips are tappable only when a metadata catalogue is behind the page.
// A source reports its genres as plain strings and filters by its own list —
// many sources have no genre filter at all — so the tap would search a
// different library than the one on screen.
//
// The first attempt gated on `detail == null`, which is never true: the record
// is always passed to the tab. This pins the rule to the thing that actually
// distinguishes the two.
