/// the blocking WebView solver.
///
/// Z Mode matches a metadata title to a source BY searching it, so a
/// suppressed challenge makes that source return nothing and the matcher
/// silently drops it — nothing else records that the source would have
/// worked after a solve. Same shape as [NovelCloudflare]
/// (lib/core/lnreader/novel_cloudflare.dart): a provider swallows its own
/// failure (an empty result, not an exception), so the fact gets stashed
/// here for whoever renders the affected UI to pick up and act on.
///
/// In-memory only, on purpose: this is a transient signal, not a
/// preference. A stale "needs solving" flag would nag about a host that has
/// since started working, so it is never persisted to Hive.
